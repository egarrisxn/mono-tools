# Mono Tools

This template is for creating a monorepo with Turborepo, shadcn/ui, tailwindcss v4, and react v19.

## Usage

in the root directory run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a shadcn/ui component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

## Addding Components

To add components to your app, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@init add button -c apps/[*insert app file*]
```

This will place the ui components in the `packages/ui/src/components` directory.

## Using components

To use the components in your app, import them from the `ui` package.

```tsx
import { Button } from "@repo/ui/components/ui/button";
```

## Tailwind

Your `globals.css` are already set up to use the components from the `ui` package which is imported into each app.

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd mono-tools
pnpm build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd mono-tools
pnpm dev
```

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```
cd mono-tools
pnpm dlx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
pnpm dlx turbo link
```
